description: "Behind a Mask, or A Woman's Power is a novella written by American author\
  \ Louisa May Alcott. The novella was originally published in 1866 under the pseudonym\
  \ of A. M. Barnard in The Flag of Our Union. Set in Victorian era Britain, the story\
  \ follows Jean Muir, the deceitful governess of the wealthy Coventry family. With\
  \ expert manipulation, Jean Muir obtains the love, respect, and eventually the fortune\
  \ of the Coventry family.\nSince it was republished by Madeleine B. Stern in 1975,\
  \ the novel has become important in critical reinterpretation of Alcott's corpus\
  \ of works and literary importance. Many literary critics treat the novel; for example,\
  \ one critic treated the novel as a version of the \"Beauty and the Beast\" trope,\
  \ while others provide feminist critiques of the narrative. Alcott's treatment of\
  \ themes like acting, social class, and the struggle for agency all inform these\
  \ larger discussions by critics.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
